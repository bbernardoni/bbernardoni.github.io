						Hello and welcome to my development blog for the final project of
						Computer Graphics and Interaction (DH2323). In the following posts,
						I will detail the development process behind the creation of the project.
					</p>
					<p>
						The goal of the project is to create and document something related to
						the objectives of the class. This is very open ended giving me a wide array
						of topics to choose from. As of now, I am not entirely sure what I want to
						do, but I have a couple ideas that I want to play around with before
						settling of a project specification.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before I can work on a prototype for the project, I first needed do some
						setup. Since we have used SDL for the labs, I choose to use it to handle
						window creation and input. However, I decided to use the more updated 
						SDL 2 instead of SDL 1 we used in the labs. To help me learn SDL and
						setup the prototype I used Lazy Foo' Productions 
						<a href="http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php">SDL Tutorials</a>.
						For rendering graphics I choose to use OpenGL. Again, as I do not have a 
						lot of experience with OpenGL I setup my environment with the help of an
						<a href="http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/">OpenGL tutorial</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the sake of getting a prototype up and running, I have copied some of the
						code from these two tutorials into Visual Studios and after some debugging,
						I was able to write a working framework for my prototype. Currently,
						it is able to load and render textured OBJ files with shading. I have also
						implemented rudimentary movement controls for the camera.
						A screen shot is displayed below.
					</p>

					<p>
						Once I get a better idea of what I want to do with project, I will refactor
						the code to get rid of all the global variables and so that the code is
						completely my own. But first, now that I have something working to talk
						about, I am setting up this blog. For my next post, I plan to experiment
						with the shaders and hopefully develop an interesting prototype.

					<p>
						I have started work on making a prototype. The goal of the prototype is
						to make a wireframe shader that emulates vector monitors. Vector monitors
						are an old display technology where graphics are rendered via drawing lines
						as opposed to a grid of pixels as on raster monitors. These monitors where
						occasionally used in arcade games up until the mid 1980s. These games
						include Asteroids, Tempest, Star Wars, and Battlezone as pictured here.

					<p>
						The first method I tried was to use
						<code>glPolygonMode(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_LINE)</code>. It is not a shader 
						in itself, but a rendering option in OpenGL. However, as seen here this 
						makes very thin aliased lines.

					<p>
						This method does not give me the control I want. So, I did some research
						and found that a different method <a href="http://codeflow.org/entries/2012/aug/02/easy-wireframe-display-with-barycentric-coordinates/">here</a> and <a href="http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/advanced-rendering/flat-and-wireframe-shading/">here</a>.
						This method uses barycentric coordinates which allows customizable
						anti aliasing based on the distance to the closest edge.

					<h2 id="0429">April 29, 2018: Refactoring</h2>
					<p>
						Quick update here. I have been spending a little time refactoring the code. I abstracted some of the
						code into several classes so that it will be easier to work with. Additionally, I didn't like how
						the outer edges of the wireframe were aliased in the previous post. This led to me looking into bloom
						and finding a <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Bloom">tutorial</a> on it. I also
						looked at other OpenGL topics in the tutorial which helped clean up the code even more.
