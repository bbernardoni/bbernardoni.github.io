						While I like to call this a one-dimensional graphics engine it is really
						a unique 2D graphical engine. Just like how a 3D engine rasters 
						a 3D world to a 2D viewport, this engine rasters a 2D world to a 1D viewport.
						In fact, this engine follows the same steps as a 3D engine would except
						rendering line segments instead of triangles.
						First, at each frame it calculates a transformation matrix based on where
						the character is. Then each line is iterated through the rasterization routine.
						Finally, the frame buffer is drawn to the screen.
