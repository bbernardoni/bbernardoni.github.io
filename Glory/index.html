						My team's submission to a 12-hour Gamebuild-a-thon.
						The event was held by 
						<a href="https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/gamebuilders/about.html">
						ACM Gamebuilders at UIUC</a>, a group which I am a member of.
						During the event I worked in a team of three to build 
						a 3D game in Unity following the theme of glory.
					</p>
					<h3>Game Overview</h3>
					<img src="glorySS.png" class="img-responsive pad-bot" alt="Screen Shot of the game">
					<p>
						Glory is wave based survival game set in the Colosseum.
						The player is a gladiator fighting to achieve glory.
						Spear-carrying enemies charge forward in ever increasing waves to try
						to kill our gladiator.
						If the player completes a wave without getting hit, the audience 
						will give rewards of upgraded health, power, and sword length.
						The game was developed in Unity featuring 3D graphics.
					</p>
					<h3>Gameplay Demonstration</h3>
					<p>
						Below is a video demonstration of our game.
						There is a small framerate issue since I captured the video on an underpowered laptop.
						Normally the game runs fine with exception of a few Game-Jam-esque bugs
						(see the end of the video).

					<h4>Controls</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-10">
					The player character's position is controlled through WASD of the arrow keys.
					Mouse movement controls the third person camera 
					and left click swings the sword.
					The escape key exits the game.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-2">
					<h4>Animation</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-10">
					The game employs two forms of animation.
					The first is accomplished by transforming an object directly through Unity.
					This is used to animate the swinging of the sword.
					The walking animation is made in Blender and imported into Unity.
				</div>

			<div class="row lgray-back">

					<h4>Rewards</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-10">
					If the player completes a wave without taking damage,
					the audience will give the player a reward.
					This reward increases the players health, power, and
					the length of the sword.

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-2">
					<h4>Audience</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-10">
					64 audience members are populated around the Colosseum.
					Each member jumps up and down in a sinusoidal fashion to imitate cheering.
				</div>

			<div class="row lgray-back">
				<div class="col-sm-2">
					<h4>Player Color</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-10">

					the player gradually turns to red and achieves more glory.
